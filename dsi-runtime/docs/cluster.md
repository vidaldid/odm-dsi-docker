# Run an ODM DSI Runtime Cluster on Docker

## Prerequisites

You can use the provided materials on MacOS or Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit. And you can use any Linux VM with a recent version of Docker. Before you start, make sure you have installed the following software:

* IBM ODM Decision Server Insights V8.9.0
* Docker 1.12.6
* Docker Compose 1.8.0
* Curl 7.47.0
* Build a DSI runtime docker image (see instructions in the section 'Create the docker image' of [/README.me])

Note: To be able to create the Docker image you must have an installation of IBM ODM Decision Server Insights V8.9.0.

OK, let's continue...

### Start and test a DSI cluster

The directory `samples/cluster` contains an example of a DSI cluster based on
Docker Compose. Used with Docker Swarm, the cluster can be hosted on multiple servers.
The topology of the sample cluster is using 1 catalog server, 3 runtime servers, 1 inbound and 1
outbound server. It can be modified by changing the file `docker-compose.yaml`.

To start the DSI cluster:
```sh
cd $DSI_DOCKER_GIT/dsi-runtime/samples/cluster
docker-compose up
```

Wait until the cluster is ready, the output should end with:
```

Deploy the "simple" solution:
```sh
cd $DSI_DOCKER_GIT/dsi-runtime/samples/cluster
./solution_deploy.sh $DSI_HOME
```

The command deploys the solution to all the DSI runtimes and the connectivity to the DSI inbound
server. The HTTPS port of the first DSI runtime is bound to the port 9443 of the host.

Then you can send an event using:
```sh
cd $DSI_DOCKER_GIT/dsi-runtime/samples/cluster
./create_person.sh jeanfi
```

Finally, verify that it has created the entity, by opening a browser and entering the
URL https://localhost:9443/ibm/ia/rest/solutions/simple_solution/entity-types/simple.Person.
